# seat_assignment
This is a coding project I did for a company's coding challenge. Keep in mind, I learned Python in a week to produce it. I'm open to any suggestions for improvement.

Expected behavior, run the program with python seat_assignment.py xmldocument.xml and get back a xlmdocument titled JSON.
